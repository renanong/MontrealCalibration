2023-08-21T15:19:46,469  WARN PrepareForSimImpl:229 'usePersonIdForMissingVehicleId' is deprecated. It will be removed soon.
2023-08-21T15:20:11,437  WARN TimeAllocationMutatorModule:128 Please be aware that durations of activities now can mutate freely and possibly become negative.This might be a problem if you have 
a) short activities that are only provided with duration and not with endtime  AND
b) agents with only one or two initial plans.
This can have impact on scoring and maybe even on qsim execution. It is recommended to set affectingDuration=false for such set up.
2023-08-21T15:20:11,442  WARN ExpBetaPlanChanger:102 Would make sense to revise this once more.  See comments in code.  kai, nov08
